MobHide
======

I created this plugin because some people on my server enjoyed the challenge of hard mode while others simply wanted to play on peaceful. With this plugin you can allow certain users to be invisible to mobs and take no damage from them. Players of all difficulty preferences can now play in harmony.

Features
------------
* Automatically cancels all entity targets of player type so it's as if mobs never even saw hidden players.
* Light weight.
* Zero configuration, simply drag and drop.


Permission Node(s)
------------------------
MobHide uses one single permission node, give the permission to all users you want to be **safe** from mobs.

* **`mobhide.hidden`**
